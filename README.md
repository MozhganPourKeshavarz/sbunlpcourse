Items that this project will cover

#Tasks 
For each of the below tasks there is an input and oputput format that needs to be defined. It is preferred that the formats to be unified to make more use of data in diffrenet tasks. 
## Tokenization & Segmentation
### Input File
In this task the input will be a plain text file (.txt) It will be UTF-8 encoded and can be very large (up to giga bytes)  

### Output File
With each input file the tools must produce a file with same name but a differnet  extension (.out)
The (.out) file is a tab dellimited format.  Each line of the file starts with the token that is identified. The next entries will be used for other tasks (e.g. Stemming) 
An empty line means end of a sentence. 
###  Test File 
The test file will contain the same format file as output but with (.ref) extenstion
